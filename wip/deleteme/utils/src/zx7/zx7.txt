"ZX7" - by Einar Saukas
=======================

"ZX7" is an optimal LZ77/LZSS data compressor for all platforms, including the
ZX-Spectrum.

Available implementations of standard LZ77/LZSS compression algorithm use either
a "greedy" or "flexible parsing" strategy, that cannot always guarantee the best
possible encoding. In comparison, "ZX7" provides a highly efficient compression
algorithm that always generate perfectly optimal LZ77/LZSS encoding. Technically
it means compressing within space and time O(n) only.


=====
USAGE
=====

To compress a file, use the command-line compressor as follows:

    zx7 Cobra.scr

This will generate a compressed file called "Cobra.scr.zx7".

Afterwards choose a decompressor routine in assembly Z80 for the ZX-Spectrum,
according to your requirements for speed and size:

  * "Standard" routine: 69 bytes only

  * "Turbo" routine: 90 bytes, about 25% faster

  * "Mega" routine: 244 bytes, about 30% faster

Finally compile the chosen decompressor routine and load the compressed file
somewhere in memory. To decompress data, just call the routine specifying the
source address of compressed data in HL and the target address in DE.

For instance, if you compile the decompressor routine to address 65000, load
"Cobra.scr.zx7" at address 51200, and want to decompress it directly to the
screen, execute the following code:

    LD    HL, 51200  ; source address (put "Cobra.scr.zx7" there)
    LD    DE, 16384  ; target address (screen memory in this case)
    CALL  65000      ; decompress routine compiled at this address

LICENSE

The optimal C compressor is available under the "BSD-3" license. In practice,
this is relevant only if you want to modify its source code and/or incorporate
the compressor within your own products. Otherwise, if you just execute it to
compress files, you can simply ignore these conditions.

The Z80 assembly decompressors can be used freely within your own ZX-Spectrum
programs, even for commercial releases. The only condition is that you must
indicate somehow in your documentation that you have used "ZX7".

HISTORY
=======

2012-12-30: Initial release (with optimal compressor and Z80 decompressors)

2012-12-31: Minor changes to source code since it wasn't strictly ANSI C (thanks
            to Metalbrain!)

2013-01-03: Minor changes to data format increasing maximum offset by 6% thus
            improving compression, and some improvements in the "Standard" Z80
            routine (thanks to Antonio Villena!)

2013-01-05: Further improvements in the "Standard" Z80 routine (thanks to
            Metalbrain!)

2013-02-25: Further improvements in the "Turbo" Z80 routine, released libraries
            for z88dk and Boriel's ZX BASIC.

The compressed file format is directly based (although slightly improved) on
  Team Bomba's Bitbuster - http://www.teambomba.net/bombaman/downloadd26a.html
  and Gasman's Bitbuster Extreme - www.west.co.tt/matt/speccy/apology/

Some of the size improvements used in "Standard" version were suggested by
  Antonio Villena and Metalbrain.

The main speed improvement used in "Turbo" version was originally suggested by
  Urusergi for Magnus Lind's Exomizer - http://hem.bredband.net/magli143/exo/

The optimal LZ77/LZSS compress algorithm was invented by myself (Einar Saukas).
  To the best of my knowledge, there was no similar high-performance solution
  available. I thereby present this implementation as evidence of "prior art",
  thus preventing anyone from ever patenting it. Software patents are evil!!!

;;
;; Function: cpct_miniload
;;
;;    Load a binary block of data from cassette and copy it to a given
;; place in memory. Pulse length of data bytes must be 740T (1T = 1/3500000s)
;;
;; C Definition:
;;    <u8>  <cpct_miniload>  (void* *mem_load*, u16 *size*) __z88dk_callee;
;;
;; Input Parameters (4 Bytes):
;;  (2B IX) mem_load - Pointer to the place in memory where loader will start to copy loaded bytes
;;  (2B DE) size     - Size in bytes of the binary block that will be read from cassette
;;
;; Assembly call (Input parameters on registers):
;;    > call cpct_miniload_asm
;;
;; Return value (Assembly calls, return L):
;;    <u8>  - (0) = successful loading (no error), (>0) = error happened during loading
;;
;; Other return values (Only for assembly calls)
;;    Carry - Set(1) = successful loading, NotSet(0) = error happened
;;     H    - Final checksum (255 if everything went ok)
;;     DE   - Remaining bytes to be read (0 if everything went ok)
;;     IX   - Final memory address (IX+DE if everything went ok)
;;
;; Parameter Restrictions:
;;    * *mem_load* must be a pointer to the byte where loaded bytes will start
;; to be copied to. Bytes will be copied from *mem_load* onwards into memory.
;; There is no restriction on were this pointer can point to, but it is 
;; programmer's responsibility to ensure that loaded bytes will not overwrite
;; any important data in memory. This function does not do any check in this sense.
;;    * *size*  must be the exact size of the block of bytes that will be loaded
;; from cassette. Erroneous sizes will make loading fail. Moreover, erroneous 
;; sizes could also make loaded data to overwrite valid data from memory. It is
;; programmers responsibility to give correct size values. 
;;
;; Known limitations:
;;    * This function *will not work from a ROM*, as it uses self-modifying code.
;;    * This function does not do any kind of boundary or size checking. If you
;; give an incorrect value for *size* or your *mem_load* pointer is placed wrong,
;; undefined behaviour will happen. This will probably make your programs hang
;; or crash.
;;    * It disables interrupts on call, and re-enables them on return. If you
;; wanted interrupts to be disabled, disable them after calling this function
;; or comment the line with instruction 'ei' for your own version of this routine.
;;
;; Details:
;;    This function loads a binary block of data from cassette tape directly
;; to a given place in memory (*mem_load*). Raw blocks of data must be codified
;; in cassette tape as pulses of length 740T (being T = 1/3500000s). Expected
;; codification is 2 pulses (full) = 1 bit. The duration of both pulses is used
;; to distinguish a 1 from a 0. As our period is 740T, the standard duration of
;; of a 0 would be 2*740T = 1480T. A 1 would be 2 times the duration of a 0, taking
;; 4*740T=2960T. To make it fault tolerant, the middle of both values is considered 
;; as discriminant. Therefore, 2 pulses of less than 3*740T = 2220T would be 
;; considered a 0, and if they are above 2220T, that would be considered a 1. 
;; As an overflow condition, a value over 400% the length of a 0 (8*740T = 5920T) 
;; would be considered as overflow, giving an error condition. All this makes 
;; the function perform at approximately 1576,58 bits per second. (197,07 bytes per second).
;; 
;;    If there are failures during cassette loading, cassette motors are stopped
;; and the routine returns with an error code (1). Then you may ask user to 
;; rewind and load the block of data again, make a cold reboot or any other 
;; thing you consider.
;;
;; Use example:
;;    This example shows how to create a simple cassette loader using miniload.
;; Cassette tape will need to have the binary of the game encoded in miniload
;; format, 2 pulses per bit and 740T of pulse duration.
;; (start code)
;;     #include <cpctelera.h>
;;     
;;     // Memory address where the binary of the game has to be loaded
;;     #define LOAD_ADDRESS  (void*)0x100
;;     // Memory address where main function of the game starts
;;     #define RUN_ADDRESS   (void*)0x3D08
;;     // Exact size in bytes of the binary of the game, that will be loaded from cassette
;;     #define BIN_SIZE      15396
;;     
;;     // Loader code starts here
;;     void main(void) {
;;        // Define a function pointer to main function of the game 
;;        // And directly initialize it to the memory address where 
;;        // the function starts. This function is void main(void)
;;        void (*gameMain)() = RUN_ADDRESS;
;;     
;;        // Load the binary of the game at the memory address where
;;        // it expects to be. It is important to give the exact byte
;;        // size of the block to be loaded, or errors will happen.
;;        // If loading is successful (return value = 0), 
;;        //  call gameMain to start the game.
;;        if ( !cpct_miniload(LOAD_ADDRESS, BIN_SIZE) )
;;           gameMain();
;;     
;;        // If loading is not successful, execution will reach end
;;        // of main, returning control to firmware and normally 
;;        // producing a machine reset
;;     }
;; (end code)
;;
;;    This simple example would generate a binary (that we may call LOADER.BIN) 
;; that expects to be placed first in the cassette. This first binary will be
;; encoded in a standard firmware loader format. Immediately afterwards, the
;; cassette will contain a second binary (we will call it GAME.BIN) taking up 
;; 15396 bytes of space (BIN_SIZE) codified in 2 pulses per bit and 740T of 
;; pulse duration (MINILOAD basic format). This second binary will be loaded 
;; at 0x100 in memory, taking from there to 0x100 + 15396 = 0x3D24. On successful
;; loading, gameMain() is called jumping to address 0x3D08 and starting 
;; the game if all went well.
;;
;;    Considering this, the layout of the cassette should be as follows
;; (start code)
;;               ---------------------------------------------------------
;;    Contents > | P | LOADER.BIN | P | GAME.BIN                         |
;;    Format   > | - |  Firmware  | - | Miniload basic format (raw1full) |
;;               ---------------------------------------------------------
;; P = Pause (Silence)
;; (end code)
;;
;; Destroyed Register values: 
;;      C-bindings - AF, BC, DE, HL, 
;;    ASM-bindings - AF, BC, DE, HL, IX
;;
;; Required memory:
;;      C-bindings - 131 bytes 
;;    ASM-bindings - 118 bytes
;;
;; Time Measures:
;;    Using miniload basic format, there are 2 pulses per bit, each pulse taking either
;; 740T for a 0, or 1480T for a 1. Therefore, a 0 takes 2*740T = 1480T and a 1 takes
;; 4*740T = 2960T. We can consider its mean value, 3*740T = 2220T per bit.
;; As 1 T = 1/3500000s, Each bit takes 1b = 2220 / 3500000 s = 0,000634285714286 secs.
;; Therefore, 1 byte 1B = 8 x 1b = 0,00507428571429 s. 
;; Dividing, 1 sec can load 197,072072072 bytes, or equivalently, 1576,57657658 bits.
;; 
;;    That makes this loader run at a estimated average speed of:
;;    - 1576,58 bits per second
;;    -  197,07 bytes per second
;;    -    0,19 Kb per second
